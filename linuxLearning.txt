* here we have installed nodemon globally by giving -g tag command used was: sudo npm install -g nodemon
* so when ever we need nodemon in a certain project we just have to create a symbolic link to the target directory (or) simply again install in that project by using 
  npm install nodemon express body-parser. like this we can install all these modules for each and every project so that we get them in dependencies list of package.json
  
  * this is the command for creating symbolic link to the target directory(in most case not needed)
    example:sudo ln -s /home/vishwa/webDev/WeatherProject /usr/local/lib/node_modules/nodemon
    here the basic syntax is sudo ln -s /target/  /where/nodemon/is/installed
* the command to get version of body-parser module is npm --version body-parser. NO THIS WILL GIVE VERSION OF NPM AND NOT BODY-PARSER
* to remove a certain file from staging area of git
  git rm --cached file.name
* to remove a certain folder from staging area of git
   git rm -r --cached folder_name
* to see all files in stating area of git
  git ls-files
* to see all hidden files and normal files in a folder
  ls -a
* to see all normal files in a folder
  ls -l 
* npm install
  after downloading starting files for a project, we check all dependencies from package.json and after that we give this command, which will install all the dependencies
  required for that project and of the same version. So that we dont have to install all packages separately
  if some vulnerabilities are there then run these commands 
  * npm audit
  * npm audit fix --force
